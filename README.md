# Contents

Hi, this is a test format that I've created to begin learning the ins and outs of git(hub). The contents of this file are listed as headers. I think this should be pretty short, so I won't add a redundant table of contents here. 
# Getting Started

There's not much you need to get started with here, as there's not much content yet. I have a few planned projects that I'll work on for fun. At that time, when I create the new ReadMe's I'll probably include some basic instructions here.
# License

I should look into this section more. I don't think that any of the work that I will do will need licenses on my personal page, but this is worth verifying. 
# Contributing

All work done here will be my own! If I have help from any other contributors, I'll be sure to link their information in this section!
# Maintainer

I might never revisit this page as it's just a test file. Otherwise, I'll probably end up deleting this altogether, as it doesn't really serve much purpose.
